# Natural Language Processing<br>

In NLP Practise notebook I was practising and getting a hands-on NLP specific libraries such as - Spacy, NLTK and TextBlob<br>
I tried techniques like Bag of Words, Word Vectors<br>
Also got to know about Stemming, Lemmitization and Stopwords which are used for cleaning the text data<br>
I have started exploring these libraries, as I learn more will keep updating this notebook.
